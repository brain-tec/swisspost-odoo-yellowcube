  Test discounts [FIXED+PERCENTAGE]. 
   Test a percentage and a fix price.
  a) I create an account invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_5}:
    account_id: account.a_recv
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_sale
        name: '[PCSC234] PC Assemble SC234'
        price_unit: 450.0
        quantity: 1.0
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        uos_id: product.product_uom_unit
        invoice_line_tax_id: []
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_12
    reference_type: none
-
  I check that Initially customer invoice state is "Draft"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_5}:
    - state == 'draft'

-
  Create a discount invoice lines which value is percentage 10. sequence 1.
-
  !record {model: stage_discount.discount_line, id: discount_line_51}:
    discount_type: 'fixed'
    discount_value: 100
    sequence: 1
    description: 'Fixed'
    invoice_id: account_invoice_5

-
  Create a discount invoice lines which value is percentage 10. sequence 2.
-
  !record {model: stage_discount.discount_line, id: discount_line_52}:
    discount_type: 'percentage'
    discount_value: 10
    sequence: 2
    description: 'Percentage'
    invoice_id: account_invoice_5

-
  Calculate the discount
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    self.button_reset_taxes(cr, uid, [ref("account_invoice_5")])

-
  f) Check discount amount of 10% and 100 â‚¬ over 450.
  450 - 100 - 10%
  450 - 100 - 45 = -145 discount
-

  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_5}:
    - amount_discount == -145
    - amount_untaxed == 305
    - amount_tax == 0
    - amount_total == 305.0
-
  I Validate invoice by clicking on Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_5}

-
  Check balance
-

  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_5}:
    - amount_discount == -145
    - amount_untaxed == 305
    - amount_tax == 0
    - amount_total == 305.0  
    - residual  == 305.0
 
-
  I verify that account move is created, and contains valid values.
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    inv = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('account_invoice_5'))
    move = inv.move_id
    assert(len(move.line_id) == 4), ('Only 4 lines should appear, but',len(move.line_id))
    for line in move.line_id:
         assert(line.credit!=0 or line.debit!=0), ('Both lines cannot be 0')
         assert(line.debit in [305.0, 0, 45.0, 100.0]), ('Debit can only belong to these values but it is:',line.debit)
         assert(line.credit in [0, 45.75, 450.0]), ('Credit can only belong to these values but it is:', line.credit)
         assert(line.state=='valid'), ('It should be in state valid')
