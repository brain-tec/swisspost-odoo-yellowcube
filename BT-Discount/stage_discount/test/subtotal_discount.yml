  Test discounts [SUBTOTAL].
  a) I create an account invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_2}:
    account_id: account.a_recv
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_sale
        name: '[PCSC234] PC Assemble SC234'
        price_unit: 450.0
        quantity: 1.0
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        uos_id: product.product_uom_unit
        invoice_line_tax_id: []
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_12
    reference_type: none
-
  b) I check that Initially customer invoice state is "Draft"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_2}:
    - state == 'draft'

-
  c) I create a discount invoice line which value is fixed and 20.
-
  !record {model: stage_discount.discount_line, id: discount_line_21}:
    discount_type: 'subtotal'
    discount_value: 0
    description: 'Example fixed amount'
    is_rounded: true
    invoice_id: account_invoice_2

-
  d) Calculate the discount
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    self.button_reset_taxes(cr, uid, [ref("account_invoice_2")])

-
  Check subtotal over 450. Subtotal does nothing.
-

  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_2}:
    - amount_discount == 0
    - amount_untaxed == 450
    - amount_tax == 0
    - amount_total == 450
-
  I Validate invoice by clicking on Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_2}

-
  Check balance
-

  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_2}:
    - amount_discount == 0
    - amount_untaxed == 450
    - amount_tax == 0
    - amount_total == 450    
    - residual  == 450
 
-
  I verify that account move is created, and contains valid values.
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    inv = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('account_invoice_2'))
    move = inv.move_id
    assert(len(move.line_id) == 2), ('Only 2 lines should appear ',len(move.line_id))
    for line in move.line_id:
         assert(line.credit!=0 or line.debit!=0), ('Both lines cannot be 0')
         assert(line.debit in [450.0,  0]), ('Debit can only belong to these values but it is:',line.debit)
         assert(line.credit in [0,450.0]), ('Credit can only belong to these values but it is:', line.credit)
         assert(line.state=='valid'), ('It should be in state valid')
