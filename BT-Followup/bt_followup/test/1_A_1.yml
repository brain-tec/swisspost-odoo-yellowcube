  1.A.1. If the number of due days is lower than the delay for a level,
  the follow-up level is not changed, and the number of due days remains the same.

  1.A.6. The field ‘Follow-Up Level’ of the tab ‘Follow-Up’ of an invoice must be filled.

  1.A.11. One execution of the scheduler must be enough to assure that a follow-up level is update (if it has to)
